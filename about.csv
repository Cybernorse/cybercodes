",Health/Beauty,"284,651 people like this 300,478 people follow this",Confirmed Page Owner: Dr Squatch Inc,"Natural, Invigorating, Manly Soap for Men who live the Squatch lifestyle.   Jack Haldrup and AJ Fountain Esquire Magazine Top 50 Must Have Men's Product All Natural Manly Soap Made in the USA Our mission doesn't stop with suds. We guarantee the same level of care and craftsmanship for our HAIR CARE, COLOGNES, BEARD OILS, SHAVE KIT and all the groomin Our Story    It all started with a simple gander at the ingredients in store bought soap.  This invoked a whole string of uncertainties and questions.  What the h g get up we stamp our name on. Maybe you’re not the “all natural” type of guy. Maybe you enjoy your generic brand name bar or like to rub down with liquid detergent every day. But the truth is, you’re not a dish, you’re a man, and as a man you have some skin in the game, and that skin craves natural, nourishing ingredients like the ones found in our products. Check out the complete Dr. Squatch product line up and turn your shower up a notch. eck is this stuff they’re putting in here?  Is it too much to ask to be able to pronounce the things we put on our body?      Thus Sasquatch Soap Co. was born.  The idea was to create soap, specifically for men, that was simple and natural.  Sasquatch was the perfect embodiment of this spirit.  So we went out and formed it, a quality handcrafted soap bar made with carefully chosen ingredients that benefit you.      We believe in transparency and trust in our relationships in business and life.  We are a small, home grown company with a big vision to impact others in positive and educative ways.  We truly value the good earth our ingredients come from and believe in experiencing and preserving it for years to come.  Just like Sasquatch who roams vast lands, we too enjoy exploring and pursuing an active life.  The wild forests, lakes, mountains, rivers, islands, and oceans are just as much a part of us as we are a part of them.  We believe in sustainability and responsibility of Sasquatch Soap’s impact from the soil to the skin and back again.      There are only 3 of us and we’re childhood friends and family.  Growing up in the same neighborhood we dreamed, from our early days at swim practices all the way through our shared high school marketing classes, to someday make a difference through originality and creativity.  As we grew and learned through other pursued life experiences we never let go of the dream.  Today we firmly believe our dream lives, in Sasquatch Soap’s ability to let men unleash their inner man, in all the glory of everyday adventure, independence and freedom.        Soap Making Process    We knew our soaps had to be made with care and individuality so we chose to use the wholesome ""Cold Process"" method for our soap bars.  Lye is mixed with water, our natural base oils, and butters.  The lye forms with the oils during the process and causes the oils to ""saponify"" or harden over time.  When the soap is completely cured, there is very little or no lye retained in the soap as it is removed during this process.    Cold Process means that our bars are saponified without added heat and take about 4-6 weeks to harden and cure before the soap is ready for use.  The bars are hand poured and hand cut in Indiana (where we grew up).  All of our bars contain a base of oils that have been thoughtfully chosen by us to combine into a bar that is cleansing, moisturizing, and invigorating: (Olive, Coconut, Hemp, Soy, Shea Butter).  In addition the bars may contain exfoliants such as oatmeal, peppermint leaves, or sea salt that give additional health benefits.    One of the biggest benefits of our soap making process vs. conventional soap or body wash is that it is true soap and not detergent.  This means that it is much better for your skin as it retains all of the vegetable glycerin that is often stripped in commercially made soaps to be used in other products such as moisturizers.  Each of our main ingredients has individual moisturizing properties, but through experimentation and research we’ve formed a foundation in our soaps that work interdependently.  Our ingredients complement each other and truly allow your skin to experience the natural moisturizing benefits throughout the day.  From start to finish our soap has been carefully made with a precise natural element of cleanliness in mind."

Thank you Takis was passing from the rubbish area of his hometown Ierapetra Greece and that changed his life. There he found a dog with a broken leg that he started to ta ke care. Soon he was taking care of 40 dogs in that area. People started threatening him so Takis bought a land and built Takis shelter in 2013. Soon Takis’ money run out and he had no help from local authorities or from the government. He created this facebook page in 2015 so that people can see his work and donate. Takis is running the shelter alone and the shelter is running 100% from donations. The shelter now hosts more than 350 dogs, 50 cats, 6 goats and 2 sheep. The monthly expenses of the shelter are around 8.000 euros.   The situation in Greece is very difficult concerning animals. The economic crisis caused a lot of people to abandon their dogs on the streets and because Greeks did not castrate their pets these dogs multiplied and now there are thousants of stray dogs and cats in Greece and thousants more are being born every day. Most of them wander the streets, malnurished in terrible condition and the government does nothing. So the burdain falls on Greek people to help. Many help but many look away and do not care. Takis has devoted his life into helping the animals in Greece and also helping people change their attitude towards them.  Takis shelter needs first and foremost people to adopt its dogs and cats. Takis wants to do responsible adoptions so that his dogs and cats never suffer again. For this reason he doesn’t ship animals. If you want to adopt an animal from Takis Shelter you will have to book a flight to Crete, visit the shelter, see the dogs and then choose and take the animal home with you.  If you cannot adopt you can donate. Even the smallest donation counts.

Martin’s passions for music, his instinctive rhythmic style, and a zest for performing, are all rooted in his success. He is a multi-talented phenomenon as an actor, a New York Times Best Seller, and a passionate philanthropist and unparalleled humanitarian.    Born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Martin’s innate musical talent was evident from an early age. In school he participated in plays and in choir, leading him to appear in in television commercials by age eight. At ten years old, he joined the latin boy band Menudo and was the lead singer for five years before forging his own musical path in 1991.    Martin was featured during the closing ceremony of the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. His international hit La Copa de la Vida (The Cup of Life) became the Official Song of that year. American audiences then became captivated by Martin during an electric performance of La Copa de La Vida at the 41st GRAMMY Awards. The production became a historic and cross-cultural moment in the music industry, marking the surge of Latin pop music’s popularity in a mostly American pop dominated market. Months later, Martin was featured on the cover of Time Magazine, titled Ricky Martin: Latin Music Goes POP. He has since continued to receive global praise across Latin America, Australia, Asia, and within the U.S.  Martin’s tenth studio album, A Quien Quiera Escuchar, was released on February 2015 debuting at No.1 on U.S. and Puerto Rico album charts. It also won Best Latin Pop Album at the 2016 Grammy® Awards. Martin continues to be seen in his residency “ALL IN” at the Park Theatre at Monte Carlo Resort and Casino this May & June.    His early acting roots and love for performing have also led him to the stage and screen. His Broadway debut as Marius in Les Misérables later landed him the role of Ché in the first revival of Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber's seven-time Tony Award-winning musical EVITA in 2012. His television credits include a guest star role on Ryan Murphy’s hit high school musical series, GLEE, and most recently, Martin has joined forces with Ryan Murphy once again. He currently stars as Antonio D’Amico, Gianni Versace’s long-time partner, and opposite Edgar Ramirez, Darren Criss, and Penelope Cruz in the FX Drama Series, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.    Martin’s highly praised autobiography, ME, gave audiences an intimate look into his personal life journey and became a New York Times Bestseller in 2011. His passion for inspiring his younger audiences to dream big and go after their dreams led him to then write a children’s book, Santiago the Dreamer in Land Among the Stars, which also landed on the bestseller list in 2013.  Martin is an inspiration and success not only in the artistic realm, but undoubtedly through his philanthropic missions as well. In 2004 he founded The Ricky Martin Foundation, an organization dedicated to denouncing and exposing global human trafficking, a worldwide crime that enslaves approximately 30 million people, 5.5 million of which are children. For over a decade the organization has pioneered as leaders in human trafficking research, education, and community initiative within Puerto Rico and The Caribbean.  After the catastrophic Hurricanes Irma and Maria of Puerto Rico in 2017, Martin was compelled to start an initiative to revive his homeland. The Ricky Martin Foundation organized The Puerto Rico Relief Fund with an initial goal to raise $6 million in aid. To date, the fund has raised almost $5 million, $4,664,927 to be exact. 53,509 donors have contributed, including individuals worldwide, celebrity endorsements, partnering organizations, and large corporations. asculino del año""      1999 - Grammy “Best Latin Pop Performance”    2000 - ABC Radio Music Awards - ""Most Requested Artist""    2000 - ALMA Awards - ""Special Achievement, Male Entertainer of the Year"", ""Outstanding Music Video""     2001 - Latin Grammy Award -Best Short Form Music Video  - ""She Bangs""        2007 - Latin Grammy Award - Best Male Pop Vocal Album  - MTV Unplugged    2007 - Latin Grammy Award - Best Long Form Music Video  -MTV Unplugged  Anglo and Global  Tencer and Associates PR, Inc.

And to use Innovation, Design, and Technology to make cosmetic smiles more accessible and more affordable than ever before.

Q: Do you have a location in my area?  A: We service every one of our clients from a single location in North Texas, USA. It doesn't matter if you're in Brisbane Australia or Manchester England, the process is always the same. We work with our clients remotely to give them a custom designed smile from anywhere in the world. We call it our Lab Direct process and it's absolutely incredible!    Q: How do you fit them / What if they don't fit?  A: Each of our clients receives a specialized impression system that allows them to take impressions of their own teeth at home. Our designers use that impression along with photos of your teeth, to design a custom smile that's custom fit to you. If for some reason the veneers don't fit, we will adjust (or even remake) them for you, at no additional charge. That's part of our 100% satisfaction guarantee.    Q: What does it cost?  A: Our prices can vary from time to time, so always check   for the most up-to-date pricing information. To give you an idea - a single arch (8-10 teeth) is around the same price you'd pay to prep and place a single traditional porcelain veneer. Double arches (top and bottom) are around the price of a single dental implant. That's why we can so we're the affordable alternative to the dentist.    Q: Can I eat with them?  A: We try to make the point that our veneers are cosmetic and not designed to replace the function of real teeth, but no matter what we say, the majority of our clients choose eat in their veneers anyway. And although it works well for most of them, each case is unique, so the ability to do so varies from client to client. For those who choose to eat in the veneers, we suggest avoiding any particularly hard or sticky foods and to cut tougher foods into smaller, more manageable bites to avoid challenging the veneer.    Q: How long does it take?  A: Our standard processing is approximately 30 business days starting when we receive your impressions. If you'd like to get your new smile faster than that, we offer Express and Ultra Express processing, which can reduce processing times to approximately 14 and 7 days respectively.    For more information, or immediate assistance, please visit   or call us at 888-257-2455.    Brighter Image Lab : The online dental lab that is changing the way people think about changing their smile.    Brighter Image Lab began in 1997 selling what has become Bilistic Teeth Cleaning and Polishing. The innovative Lab Direct Processing allowed clients to make impressions of the teeth from the comfort of their own home. Through innovation and research, the team at Brighter Image Lab developed the Bilistic Detox Serum, a solution which is designed to penetrate the tooth and not only bleach stains, but remove them.    The same Lab Direct Process was then used in 2010 to create Press On Veneers, a removable dental veneer designed to hold to existing teeth and cover gapped teeth, missing teeth, misaligned teeth, crooked teeth, and chipped teeth. Seven years of research culminated as this year, 2017, Brighter Image Lab has launched a New Signature Version of removable veneers called BilVeneers, which are carefully crafted for a more natural appearance.    Using the same technology to create Rebil Snore Guards, Brighter Image Lab has now solidified it's place as the leading online dental lab in Fort Worth, TX. You can find Brighter Image Lab clients worldwide, from the UK AU NZ Canada, Brazil, and Mexico City. “Our Biggest complaints deal with serving newer countries that are not English speaking, but we continue do it and are getting better every month,” says Bil Watson, Director. Brighter Image Lab is considered the market leader for lab direct/online dental contrivances and the #1 alternative to a Snap on Smile dentist. ""We believe people should be able to improve their smile, and the technology now makes it possible to avoid the scams of online products that cannot compete with the professional reviews enjoyed by Brighter Image Lab.""

","Musician/Band,Actor,Record Label",,,"Birmingham, Alabama Atlantic Records Official Facebook page of Gucci Mane! Atlanta, GA Before achieving widespread success as an entertainer, actors and rappers are forced to endure a series of hardships. But few have gone through the same kind of  trials and tribulations that Gucci Mane has.  Despite the pitfalls, Gucci Mane takes each moment in stride, both playfully and insightful.    After building up a solid buzz in the South in the early 2000s thanks to the overwhelming success of his infectious 2003 club anthem, “Icy,” featuring fellow up-and-coming Southern rapper Young Jeezy, Gucci Mane caught an attempted murder charge during a much-publicized beef with Jeezy and had to serve a year in prison. Upon his return, he released his debut album, Trap House, his stellar sophomore project, Hard To Kill, and his 2007 major label debut, Back To The Trap House, before eventually being forced to serve another year-long prison sentence for a probation violation stemming from a 2005 incident.    But Gucci Mane wouldn’t let a second major legal battle stop his movement. Instead, he jumped into the studio for days at a time before his sentence started and recorded dozens of songs that he eventually released through his So Icey Entertainment and 1017 Brick Squad Records imprints while he was incarcerated to help keep his name alive in the streets. It worked, and by the time Gucci Mane was released in March 2009, his buzz was better than ever and he immediately started recording songs for what would become his second major label album, The State Vs. Radric Davis.    By late 2009, the album was finished. Featuring the smash singles, “Wasted,” and “Spotlight,” featuring Usher, The State Vs. Radric Davis was shaping up to be the biggest release of Gucci Mane’s career. While he had already enjoyed plenty of success in the South and routinely made thousands of dollars for performing at shows every night, the album was projected to move him into the upper echelon of rap. He looked like he was primed to end the year on a positive note. Unfortunately, he had one more hurdle to clear—and it was a big one.    In November 2009, just a few weeks before the album hit stores, Gucci Mane found himself getting thrown behind bars again for breaking the terms of his probation. It was devastating for his fans, his followers and, most importantly, himself.  “Unfortunately, my incarceration also came at a pivotal point in my career, just as my first major label album was dropping,” Gucci Mane admitted later. “I was forced to miss what should have been one of the proudest moments of my life.”    He didn’t let those moments go to waste, though. While in prison serving a one-year sentence, Gucci Mane wrote rhymes constantly, stayed in touch with his Brick Squad affiliates Waka Flocka Flame and DJ Holiday and set the stage for his return by releasing an official mixtape, The Burrrprint 2 HD, in March, which moved more than 15,000 units in its’ first week in stores. All of this prepared Gucci Mane to get back on his grind when he released from prison in May.    And grind he did. He released several notable mixtapes, including Jewelry Selection hosted by DJ Holiday in August and Ferrari Music hosted by DJ Drama in September, toured the country and also completed The Appeal—his second major label album through So/Icey/Asylum/Warner Bros. Records. With the help of a strong first single, “Gucci Time,” featuring Swizz Beatz, and guest appearances from Ray J, Pharrell, Nicki Minaj, Wyclef and Bun B—as well as production efforts from Drumma Boy, Zaytoven, and the Neptunes—Gucci Mane proved that you might be able to lock him up, but you certainly can’t lock him down.    It wasn't before long, however, that Gucci Mane was back in infamy's unforgiving life.  At the end of 2010 and beginning of the New Year, the rapper was involved in a series of well-publicized events including a relapse in his rehabilitation, being detained in a police raid, undergoing a psychiatric evaluation, and the acquisition of an uncanny face tattoo.     But it appears that Gucci Mane is now in a better place and is getting back to the music.  On March 22, the Atlanta enigma will release the next chapter in his series of street albums titled The Return of Mr. Zone 6, which will be available on online music stores as well as in local retailers.    ""This street album is a return to the music that got me buzzin' in the first place,"" expresses Gucci Mane.  ""It didn't really make sense to not have some of the people who've been responsible for some of my best street records behind me.""    Gucci Mane teamed up with long-time collaborator Drumma Boy to produce the majority of the album with producers Southside and Zaytoven each contributing a song to the 13-track release.  Features on the album include Brick Squad counterparts Waka Flocka Flame, OJ Da Juiceman, Cash Money’s Birdman, Wale, Master P, Webbie, 8ball, Rocko and Wooh the Kid.     “2009 was a great year.  2010 was a hell of a year.  I’m hoping 2011 will be a hell of a great year.  This project is going to set the tone for the new decade and I can’t wait for the feedback from the supporters, haters and everyone in between.  I’m back, yall.  BRRR!!!”"

",Politician,,,"Central, South Carolina The Facebook page for United States Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina). Welcome to the Facebook page of Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC).  Here you will find the latest news and information about events near you. Thank you for joining our fight for common-sense, conservative values! Male Lindsey Graham has earned a reputation as a conservative problem-solver and one of the strongest proponents of a robust national defense.     A frequent visitor t o American troops stationed overseas for on-the-ground assessments, Graham has consistently pushed for outcomes in the War on Terror which protect our long-term national security interests. One leading conservative recently wrote that when it comes to defending America, ""[Lindsey] Graham has been right about more things on foreign policy for longer than just about anyone…if anyone has bragging rights on foreign policy, it is Graham.""     Graham is also a leader in cutting spending, reforming entitlements, and getting government out of the way so businesses can create jobs. One national conservative organization called him a Taxpayer Hero who puts ""the interests of the taxpayer ahead of politics by consistently voting to cut wasteful spending, reduce the tax burden, and make government more accountable to taxpayers.""     Graham was elected to the United States Senate in 2002 and was re-elected in 2008 and 2014. He became - and remains today - the top vote-getter in South Carolina history by garnering over one million votes in the 2008 general election.  Prior to serving in the Senate, Graham was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 as the first Republican from the Third Congressional District of South Carolina since 1877.     Before being elected to Congress, Graham compiled a distinguished record in the United States Air Force as he logged six-and-a-half years of service on active duty as an Air Force lawyer. From 1984-1988, he was assigned overseas and served at Rhein-Main Air Force Base in Germany. Upon leaving active duty Air Force in 1989, Graham joined the South Carolina Air National Guard where he served until 1995. During the first Gulf War in the early 90's, Graham was called to active duty and served state-side at McEntire Air National Guard Base as Staff Judge Advocate where he prepared members for deployment to the Gulf region.     Even today while serving as a United States Senator, Graham continues to serve his country in the United States Air Force Reserves. He is one of only three senators currently serving in the Guard or Reserves. Graham has earned the rank of Colonel and is assigned as a Senior Individual Mobilization Augmentee to The Judge Advocate General.     A native South Carolinian, Graham grew up in a blue collar family in the small town of Central where his parents ran a restaurant and pool hall. The first member of his family to go to college, Graham earned his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of South Carolina. He lives in Seneca and is a member of Corinth Baptist Church."

Origina Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, mejor conocido como “Bad Bunny,” es un joven cantautor de música urbana, más reconocido en el subgénero del Trap Latino. Origina rio de Puerto Rico, este talentoso artista ha estado rodeado por la música desde que nació, lo que lo llevó a tener una pasión por ella desde muy temprana  edad.    Durante la Navidad y para todos sus cumpleaños, Bad Bunny pedía a sus padres CDs de música: rap, reggaetón, salsa, rock, y de sus influencias musicales, artistas como Tego Calderón, VicoC, Marc Anthony, entre otros. Aunque sus padres no eran músicos, nunca le impidieron desarrollarse en el arte    y le permitieron tener un inicio muy temprano, ya que cantaba en cada ocasión que se le presentaba     en  la escuela.    Bad Bunny nunca tomó clases formales de música ni estudió ningún instrumento, pero su pasión lo    llevó a aprender y perfeccionar su  talento  de  su  propia  cuenta. Él es cantante, compositor y creador  de sus propias canciones por conocimiento propio y su música transmite un ritmo interno mucho más especial que cualquier enseñanza musical hubiera podido tener.    Tanto fue su amor por la música que comenzó a crear canciones y subirlas al popular sitio web de    video YouTube y compartirlas en las redes sociales, donde su base de fanáticos comenzó a crecer. A mediados del 2016, Bad Bunny se une a Hear This Music, disquera creada por DJ Luian y Los Mambo Kingz y que nos presentó el éxito “La Ocasión,” el himno de la música Trap.    Con el respaldo de Hear This Music, el artista ha logrado tener un éxito sin precedentes con sencillos como ""Diles,"" ""Soy Peor"" y ""Tu No Vives Así,"" y ha dominado el mundo de la música digital, ya alcanzando más de medio billón de reproducciones en sus videos en su canal oficial de YouTube y conquistando listas de popularidad en todas las plataformas digitales de música. Bad Bunny también     ha participado en temas con artistas de la talla como Farruko, De La Ghetto, J Balvin, Maluma, Nicky  Jam y Ozuna, entre otras estrellas de la música urbana.    Este año, Bad Bunny demostró su ya imponente dominio, influencia y demanda al dominar a Europa con una gira de conciertos de 20 días durante los cuales llevó a cabo 23 conciertos completamente agotados a multitudes de miles de fans, un logro monumental tan temprano en su carrera, que crece de  manera exponencial.    Alcanzando aún más metas, al regresar de Europa, el cantautor se unió a otras estrellas de la música urbana en el Latin Trap Panel, parte de la Conferencia Billboard de la Música Latina 2017, un gran paso y honor para cualquier artista en su primer año de carrera. Durante la semana, Bad Bunny estableció un nuevo estándar en la industria al proyectar excelencia con su presentación estelar durante los Premios Billboard de la Música Latina 2017, donde encendió el escenario con una interpretación de su más reciente colaboración con J Balvin, ""Si Tu Novio Te Deja Sola.""    Con una corta pero impactante carrera, Bad Bunny ha tenido un éxito colosal, donde su música no solo es escuchada en su natal Puerto Rico ni en Latinoamérica, sino también por todos los Estados Unidos y Europa.

",Retail Company,,,"The ultimate line of concealed carry holsters specifically designed to comfortably fit with almost any outfit. Urban Carry Holsters are a new breed of concealed carry holster. Unlike traditional IWB holsters, the Urban Carry offers deep concealment without sacrificing co mfort and versatility. Our genesis came in 2014 with a meeting of three incredible minds – a craftsman, a visionary, and a integrator. These three came together to create a revolutionary idea for a deep concealment holster. Our idea was to create a holster that could truly withstand the rigorous use of daily wear while being comfortable when seated. All of this needed to be done without sacrificing discretion and concealability.     Since its inception in 2014, Urban Carry Holsters has grown rapidly, getting its start exhibiting at local gun shows. Soon, it grew into a thriving national business devoted to remembering its roots of excellent customer service and excellent products to match. Even as we’ve grown the gun shows have remained a staple as we place real value in meeting our customers, sharing our product with them, and exchanging stories and ideas. As we tell our customers, “Your feedback only helps us to make a great product even better.” It is this personal commitment to our customers and our product that extends us beyond our competition.    Urban Carry is thoughtfully constructed from the finest quality saddle-grade leather and saddle-grade nylon stitching. Each of our holsters is hand sewn, individually, to allow a level of attention to detail unparalleled anywhere in our industry. Of course, our holsters are made here in the USA by our team of craftsmen and women. We are the creator, manufacturer, the distributor, and the retailer.    Our unprecedented expansion and popularity within the concealed carry industry is due to our ongoing commitment to comfort, quality, workmanship and affordable products. Our craftsmanship and quality are never compromised. Compare Urban Carry Holsters to the competition and you’ll be pleased to find Urban Carry is a cut above the rest. Try our holster, risk free, for 30 days and if you’re not completely satisfied with our product for any reason, we’ll buy it back. In addition, every holster is covered by our 10-year Manufacturer’s Warranty. If any part of your holster breaks or tears for any reason, we’ll repair or replace it for free.    Urban carry is blessed and thankful to have customers who appreciate our products, level of service, and commitment, and for that – we thank you.

",Public Figure,,,"I've turned $12,415 into over $5 million while living the dream & teaching my strategy to 10,000+ students...several millionaire students so far, who's next? I had a slightly different college experience: skipping classes in favor of trading penny stocks every day, I turned $12,415 in Bar Mitzvah gift money into $4,6 Timothy Sykes helps people learn how to trade penny stocks. He’s not some fly-by-night guru, though. All of his teachings come from real-life experience. And he 01,000 and started a hedge fund during my senior year. I also created a scholarship for talented/passionate people open not only to current Tulane students, but also Tulane faculty and alumni…an economic bailout ahead of its time.    My hedge fund went on to become the #1 ranked short bias fund by Barclay for 3 years and I was named to Trader Monthly’s ‘Top 30 Under 30′ in 2006, but my trading strategy was never very scalable (meaning it’s much easier for me to make $10,000 than it is $10 million) and my fund lost 35% when I tried long-term investing instead of trading.    Infinitely wiser but embarrassed and depressed, a TV producer asked me to make an appearance in his upcoming documentary “Wall Street Warriors”…I had lost my confidence and credibility so I said sure and ended up starring in 5 of the 6 episodes of the hit first season, which you can watch on Hulu, now having aired in 20+ countries and followed by 2 more seasons (Wall Street Warriors Season 3 was filmed but has not aired).    The show’s popularity inspired hundreds of daily emails from fans wanting to know more about me and my trading strategy, but as a hedge fund manager, I was not allowed to answer any of them. So I said “screw you!” to the restricted hedge fund industry, wrote openly about my experiences in my best-selling autobiography “An American Hedge Fund” and started a publishing company to create brutally honest & educational financial newsletters and instructional DVD packages.    I’ve been featured by every major business and financial media outlet, but I am infinitely prouder of having returned to my $12,415 Bar Mitzvah gift money roots, intent on repeating my feat of turning that into $2 million, this time detailing every step of the way on this website.    6,000 blog posts and 4+ years into this challenge, my Thinkorswim trading account has surged to $211,420, a gain of more than 1,500%, already providing you with a rough blueprint of how to turn $12k into $100k in 2 years and making me the #1 ranked trader out of 60,000+ traders on Covestor, a website which verifies trades and performance…and nearly 1/5 of the top traders are subscribers of my 4 newsletters and PennyStocking DVD students!    I’ve also enjoyed my money, traveling to over 70 countries and meeting and chatting with many of the world’s most interesting and successful people like President Obama, Richard Branson, Donald Trump, Steve Cohen of SAC Capital, James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, Michael Steinhardt, George Soros, Mark Cuban, Tom Cruise, Nouriel Roubini, Wayne Gretzky, Ken Griffey Jr. and Michael Jordan and many many more.    Battling against those in finance who misinform and lie, I’ve made enemies with soulless penny stock promoters, certain CNBC commentators, penny stock promoters who pretend to be FOX News commentators and wholly imbecilic people like Trader Monthly editor-in-thief Randall Lane who used his press connections to publicly berate me and accuse me of losing $ due to the TV show (ignoring the advance copy of the book I sent him in which I explain what went wrong) (don’t worry, he eventually got what was coming to him). Even basketball star Shaquille O’Neal sent me a cease & desist letter after I blasted him for taking shares of a penny stock pump & dump (see my comprehensive reply to the big man’s legal threats…never heard back from him and the stock has dropped 99% as I predicted it would)    I now have 2,000+ students in over 60 countries and as you can read in this blog post, some of my trading challenge students are trained killers so I better do a good job teaching them! :)    The good news is that in less than 4 years as a teacher, subscribers of my 4 newsletters have now profited over $7 million as of May 2013. ’s not skimpy with his advice, either.    After an elbow injury eliminated his aspirations as a pro tennis player – an incident his father affectionately calls his “million-dollar injury” – Tim set his sights on the stock market. In high school, he used the $12,415 he’d saved from his bar mitzvah money to invest.    Before he graduated, he’d turned that $12K into $125K. Today, he’s earned close to $5 million in profits—all from trading.    Tim started a hedge fund in college that became the #1 Barclay short-bias fund for three years. He earned a spot on Trader Monthly’s “Top 30 Under 30” list in 2006 and was recognized by President Obama for his contributions.    When his hedge fund took a big hit, he decided long-term investing wasn’t for him. He published the acclaimed book “American Hedge Fund” and decided to start talking about finance in his patented no-holds-barred style.     His experience paved the way for his appearance in five of the six first-season episodes of the hit reality show “Wall Street Warriors,” which are now streaming on Hulu.    Then Tim returned to his roots: pennystocking and day trading. He decided to start teaching others the method behind his particular degree of monetary mastery, which allowed him to help others build great wealth. In fact, some of his students have surpassed his own trades.    That’s every teacher’s goal, right?    At the very beginning of his career, Tim focused every day on the lifestyle he wished to create for himself. He didn’t (and doesn’t) trade for money.    He trades for freedom.    That freedom allows him to visit any country he wishes, buy what he wants, and spend time mentoring others. And he encourages his students to do the same: Figure out what you want out of life, then make it happen."

More accurately described as a visionary, his  YOUTUBE:   SPOTIFY:   iTUNES:   TWITTER:   artistry is not confined to the manufactured stereotypes. With his roots lying in Hip Hop, Rock ’n’ Roll, and Rap, his cinematic visuals push boundaries, are immediately identifiable, and unlike anything currently on the North American scene. As rap stars have become the new rock stars, there couldn't be a better time for Tom MacDonald.      In the past 5 months, Tom has accumulated over 15 million video views on his last 4 singles/videos, with these videos being shared cumulatively upwards of 500k times. His latest single “HELLUVIT” hit 3.5M in 3 days, is currently at 8M+, and is generating one million views every 3 days. His Facebook fans and likes grew virally at an incredible rate of 3500% in the past 5 months, and currently 200,000+ dedicated followers engage with him on Facebook. He has 50,000 active monthly listeners on Spotify, and 500,000 streams. YouTube also caught the wave and his subscribers are growing at a rate of 300% MOM.      But…this wasn't an overnight success. Tom has released 10 full-length projects with high-budget wildly creative music videos (some are short films) since beginning his career 7 years ago, and has written many songs for other artists. His growing fan-base has been intensely supportive throughout his various music and video releases.      Currently living in Los Angeles, Tom was born in Vancouver, Canada and spent most of his teenage years as a professional wrestler. By the time Tom was 17, he had wrestled across Canada, on a bi-weekly TV show in Alberta and on Pay Per View with many WWE Super Stars. Despite his immediate and ongoing success in the world of professional wrestling, his passion was for music. It was this greater passion that prompted Tom to leave the wrestling business and forge a career in the music industry.      With the “start local, think global” mentality, he has been nominated for many Canadian awards, including the prestigious Leo Award, his videos have aired on Canadian nation-wide television, including major networks like MuchMusic (MTV of Canada). He has performed as main support for Major Lazer, Madchild, Swollen Members, and toured through Europe twice in 2013/2014 with Kool Keith and Onyx.      As so many times we have seen this happen, a talented artist starts out determined to conquer the world, continues to push, and seemingly pops out of nowhere.      With the recent viral success of his music videos, and dedicated fan base growing at an exponential rate, Tom is in the middle of launching a 2018 US and Canada summer tour. His inbox is an overwhelming flow of concert offers, fan messages, and feature requests.       Never short on quality content and music, and a fire to be the biggest artist on the market, Tom intends to continue building his already established fan-base. By the end of 2018 Tom MacDonald will be a household name."

Male Maxim Trubitski is one of the most successful ecommerce dropshippers in the community. As a teenager, he is one of the youngest entrepreneurs in New York City g Featured in:      enerating multiple 6-figures a year. Today, he is a philanthropist, world-traveler, and business coach to thousands of students.    Maxim was born and raised in the southeast part of Brooklyn, Manhattan Beach. At 14, he began studying business, and since has built several sources of income.       Trubitski began his climb to the top of the industry by first building a clothing brand, Dio.  He followed this with a Modeling agency, and eventually started his own Marketing Agency, where he grew local businesses using different forms of online marketing techniques.     His teachings have inspired hundreds of young, aspiring entrepreneurs to chase their dreams, and many credit him to their successes.      One of Maxim’s true passions is traveling.  Him and his team have traveled together to Russia, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, France, Brazil, Argentina, Czech Republic, and many others.  In fact, he even took his brother and one of his good friends to Brazil as a good token of his success.  He believes that these memories with his loved ones are worth more than any dollar amount.      Now, that is not to say that he does not enjoy the financial success he is experiencing.  In 2018, Maxim generated over $400,000 in sales.  But he insists this is not what motivates him today.  What motivates him is seeing his clients succeed just as much.   He has even been quoted as saying “my biggest satisfaction comes from seeing their goals and dreams become a reality.”      In fact, Maxim has even bigger plans to give back in the future.  He is in the process of relaunching his own youth cancer charity organization. He wants to use his marketing tactics to make the world a better place, and has plans to make this one of the biggest charitable events the world has ever seen.    Trubitski has some advice to every young, aspiring entrepreneur out there.  Don’t give up.  It sounds cliche’, but he believes it to be true.  He has had his fair share of business failures, and had to rebound from them.  He says it is important to not care what people think about you, and to always remember why you started in the first place.  And remember, many people are too scared to chase their dreams in the first place.      One of his favorite quotes is from marketing expert, Jordan Belfort: “The only thing standing between you and your goal is the bullshit story you keep telling yourself as to why you can’t achieve it”.  Don’t be scared to chase your dreams, because they are a lot closer than you think.    Maxim has plans to continue being a philanthropist, business coach to hundreds of students, as well as an inspirational speaker.  His business continues to grow to new heights, and his students have been experiencing some of the same successes by following what he teaches.  Being an avid world traveler, Maxim has no plans of stopping that, as he believes there is so much beauty to be seen in the world, and so many places that he wants to experience.      Trubitski is truly an inspiring figure for any young entrepreneur looking for motivation to chase his dreams.                "

(LGBT) - and even those who do may not know how to provide services in culturally-sensitive ways. As a result, LGBT seniors often avoid seeking needed services out of fear of discrimination. The tendency for LGBT seniors to go ""back in the closet"" is particularly pronounced in situations where they are most vulnerable - such as when accessing home health care or residing in assisted living or residential care facilities. One study indicated that LGBT seniors may be as much as five times less likely to access needed health and social services because of their fear of discrimination from the very people who should be helping them.    This type of social isolation has an enormous impact in the health and wellbeing of LGBT seniors. With LGBT seniors twice as likely to live alone than heterosexual seniors, more than four times as likely to have no children, the informal caregiving support we assume is in place for older adults may not be there for LGBT elders.

It’s about being your own unique individual and embracing who you are.”“Our parents raised us to just do our best in whatever we do,” adds DJ. “That’s all it takes to be a hero. It’s not about getting notoriety at the end of the day; it’s about leading by example. You never know who you might be inspiring.”“It’s also about a sense of bravery,” Nick elaborates. “You literally have four black brothers from Decatur, GA singing rock music. Everybody looked at us like we were crazy as hell when we first decided to do this. It’s simple though. We do what we love with conviction.”They started doing so back in 2010. Growing up in a highly musical family, the boys sang in an R&B group in between playing sports. However, grandma bought them a karaoke machine, and its myriad stations caught their attention. First inspired by Coldplay’s “Clocks,” they soon fell down a rock ‘n’ roll rabbit hole, going from Queen to Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, The Beatles, Rush, and The Fray. Picking up instruments, they brought Hero The Band to life.Buckling down alongside producer Donovan Jarvis in an Atlanta studio, they honed a signature sound throughout three independent releases—Goldn Hearts[2013], Bleach[2016], and Heroshima [2017]—and logged 350-plus shows everywhere from Super Bowl Liveto AfroPunk. Not to mention, mutually collaborating with the likes of Big K.R.I.T., Childish Major, Trinidad James, Jack Harlow, and many more.As a movement quietly formed around them, LAVA Records/Republic Records signed the group in 2019. Now, they ignite their rise on the major label debut single “Back To Myself.”Produced by Pete Nappi[Meghan Trainor, Kesha, Thirty Seconds To Mars],the song pairs a steady beat with earthquaking guitars and a sweeping and soaring chant, “I’m gettingback to myself.”“It’s about arising out of a place of feeling down and suffocated or having negative thoughts in your head,” explains Justin. “You’re constantly battling yourself. So, once you movepastthose feelings, you come back to who you’re meant to be. It screams. It’s an anthem for anybody who feels lost, insecure, or like an outcast. Know you can overcome whatever you’re facing.”In the end, this uplifting spirit defines the group’s upcoming projectand overall message.  “We want to give peoplea sense of being more independent and trusting themselves. It’salsoabout remaining open to the world. You can spread love and use it to heal your own scars and wounds and others. Life is beautiful. It’s about constantly healing and keeping it real. That’s what we’re here togive.”  Although the brothers have been singing together all their life, they did not form an official group until 2008. The group name at that time was Inseparable, a fitting name for brothers who are not only close in age, but are close in heart. As Inseparable, the guys performed their own R&B originals at various clubs and talent shows throughout the Atlanta area. By 2010, the brothers officially formed the band HERO which showcases both their vocal and instrumental talents. Their sound is an evolving mixture of pop, rock, and soothing melodies. HERO just has a unique and inviting style.    ""We have been around music all of our lives, and we want to make music for the rest of our lives."" says Nick, the youngest member of the band. HERO's musical influences are Queen, Cold Play, Take 6, Boyz II Men, The Temptations, The Beatles, Elton John, Jimi Hendrix, Earth,Wind, and Fire, U2, Prince, and Lenny Kravitz. It is no surprise that the brothers play the bass and lead guitars, keys, and drums. ""Because we write our own lyrics and musical sound, it allows us to express our real emotions and share ourselves with the world"", says Jerramy. ""We are not in a box, we don't have a lead singer. We are just a mixture of different genres of music, like Michael Jackson or Andre 3000,""Justin says. As the band grows in musicianship and artistry, the band has been blessed with many phenomenal performance opportunities. The band has performed at such venues as the Masquerade, Phillip's Arena(National Anthem for the Hawks), and performed as the opening act for the legendary ""Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"" band, Mother's Finest.    HERO produces a sound that is forever timeless and inspiring to audiences of all ages. Hero's sound is captivating live audiences both locally and statewide. After performances, audiences express an overwhelming, euphoric emotion and satisfying feeling. Many fans testify, ""Their music makes me feel good.""; ""Wow, this is amazing!""    It may seem as though every hero has a quest. Some save a princess from a fire breathing dragon, others save the world from a nemesis determined to cause destruction. HERO has a different quest and that is to touch and inspire lives through their musical talents and sound. ""It is our humbleness, writing ability, and the way we work together that is so appealing. We are brothers and we work as a team."" says DJ.    HERO credits Mr. Grigsby, their chorus teacher, for motivating them to learn music and really believe and pursue their dream. Justin, Jerramy, DJ, and Nick have made a brother's pact to take this journey together as a team. This band will be the heroes that contribute fresh and dynamic musical compositions that include ""real lyrics and real sounds"" for all the world to enjoy."

Anthony Morrison Inc Anthony Morrison is an Internet Marketer who's had great success both online and offline. His main goal is to help people create success in their lives. I've authored 3 books on Internet Marketing. For more information on these books you can visit my website online:   Male Speaker, Author and Internet Entrepreneur. Featured on many TV shows and media appearances. My goal is to help you have success. Since launching his first business in 2005 when he was just twenty-one, Anthony Morrison’s career has expanded exponentially. A self-taught Internet mogul, Morr Featured In The Chicago Tribune:     ison devised a one-man business operation while attending college full-time. The success of that venture saved his family’s fortunes, and from there Morrison proceeded to devise a systematic approach to entrepreneurial success and used it to develop another eleven companies, all of which have been highly profitable.    Raised along with his brother and sister in Mississippi by Roger and Sheila Morrison, Anthony grew up in a family that encouraged intellectual curiosity, empathy for others and healthy self-esteem. Always independent and assertive, Anthony gave his parents a glimpse of his potential when, at the age of seven, he decided he wanted a Jacuzzi. Told by his mother that he would have to work to earn it, Anthony sold candy bars door-to-door until he had earned the money for the Jacuzzi. One year later, at age eight, he set his sights on buying his father a motorcycle and did just that, enlisting his siblings in the effort.    Other successful part-time ventures followed, setting a pattern for his later life: find something you enjoy, learn as much about that subject as possible, and pursue your goals with single-minded enthusiasm. Whether it was selling baseball cards or customizing his prize Mustang, Anthony showed a predilection for achieving his goals and creating avenues to achieve them more efficiently and profitably. Without realizing it, he was creating the blueprint for his later success.    When financial ruin threatened his family, Anthony expanded upon a business he’d had as a teen and established his first company, Cool Blue Performance. Within one year he was working with every parts supplier in the industry; the following year he began manufacturing his own parts and dominating the industry.    The year 2008 saw Anthony expanding into the world of publishing with his first book, The Hidden Millionaire: Twelve Principles to Uncovering the Entrepreneur in You. Part memoir, part inspirational tale and part instructional tome, The Hidden Millionaire brings Anthony Morrison’s template for success to an entire new audience. With his book in the hands of over one million people around the world Anthony hopes to share his story and inspire, motivate, and empower everyone who reads it to create their own success story.    In 2009 Anthony wrote his second book, Advertising Profits From Home, in an effort to teach people around the country how to use his techniques and strategies to create a successful online marketing campaign. Anthony has created a blueprint for a successful marketing campaign and platform for affiliate marketers around the world, and he shares these secrets in his new book.    Anthony filmed a TV show with Mark Victor Hansen, Co-Author of The Chicken Soup Series, to promote his new book on a national level.    Anthony’s show was one of the most successful in the past decade resulting in over one million copies of his book being sold world wide.    Today, Anthony Morrison travels the country sharing his story and teaching his skills to budding entrepreneurs speaking at large events. He also hosts a weekly webinar training for his students called “The Success Connection” which reaches thousands of people every week with a message focused positivity and marketing strategies to help create more success for his students.

Additionally, Wisconsin is the only state to offer a Master Cheesemaker program, patterned on the rigorous standards of similar programs in Europe.    These fine craftsmen produce nearly 2.8 billion pounds of cheese each year, over 25 percent of all domestic cheese. These quantities continue to grow to meet the nation’s demand for quality and variety of cheese from Wisconsin, America's Dairyland.    Brought to you by the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board.

Are you one of the many people wishing they had better finances. But just stay there wishing..... not really willing to do anything about improving. Please let today be a solid start in the correct direction. You have come here for reason.    It comes down to what you know and more importantly- ""what you don't know"". If you are not making, as a secondary income, $50K, 100k or 500k, it is simply because you do not know how to. That seems like a strange statement, but I think it is true. It is not anything to be ashamed of. I was in the same situation for many years. You simply have not been taught how to think and do correctly. You need to have specialized skills. Skills that will put you in position to generate more income.    Ideally you should have an income source that - you will own. That is a hugh condition to my financial plan. I do not accept that someone else will be in control of my income potential. One of the reasons I learned to trade is to own the correct knowledge. Now I am in control and own the specialized knowledge that lets me generate additional sources of income. It is very liberating.    Also you need to have income being generated while you are doing other things. We all know a job at best is just to stay afloat. No one has freedoms with a job. It is actually silly when you really think about the job mindset. We all have been programmed to go that route at some point. Thankfully I changed paths. Hopefully you will let me share with you how to do the same.    I would like to share with you what I have been doing for many years. Trading can go one of two ways- the happy way or not so happy way. Meaning, there is one of two outcomes. Either you are losing money or you are gaining the money. Obviously the losing side is the problem. After making thousands of live trades, I was able to develop, what I call a ""template"" that keeps me on the gaining side. This is what I hopefully can teach you.    IF you are ready to take steps to financial independence and completely turn around your way of seeing the work world- then join us today in learning the trading template.    Why learn this stuff-- So you can make a $1000 a day! ...from anywhere, anytime. I will share with you what I have been doing for 18 years. It is quite fascinating once you understand it.

Its four-year curricu ” resulting from civil and religious liberty and “believing that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.” It pursues the stated object of the founders: “to furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary and scientific education” outstanding among American colleges “and to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.”    The College considers itself a trustee of modern man’s intellectual and spiritual inheritance from the Judeo-Christian faith and Greco-Roman culture, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.    By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence. lum leads to the bachelor of arts or bachelor of science degree, and it is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.    Hillsdale’s educational mission rests upon two principles: academic excellence and institutional independence. The College does not accept federal or state taxpayer subsidies for any of its operations.    Located in rural southern Michigan, the nearly 400-acre Hillsdale campus includes both modern and historic buildings. Facilities include comfortable residence halls, subject-specific computer labs, a state-of-the-art health education and sports complex, Michael Alex Mossey Library with its Leighton-Taylor Wing, the Sage Center for the Arts, the Herbert Henry Dow Science Building, Howard Music Hall, and two classroom buildings—Kendall Hall and Lane Hall. Adjacent to the campus is the model primary and secondary school, Hillsdale Academy, whose comprehensive Reference Guide is used in hundreds of schools throughout the country.    An ideal student-faculty ratio of 10:1, rigorous academics, intramural sports, national fraternity and sorority houses, and widespread community volunteerism all nurture intellectual, physical, social and personal growth.

Medtronic does not practice medicine or provide medical services or advice and the information on this account should not be considered medical advice.  monitoring for the management of diabetes mellitus in persons 16 years of age or older who require insulin. Insulin infusion pumps and associated components of insulin infusion systems are limited to sale by or on the order of a physician and should only be used under the direction of a healthcare professional familiar with the risks of insulin pump therapy. The systems are not intended to be used directly for preventing or treating hypoglycemia but to suspend insulin delivery when the user is unable to respond to the Threshold suspend (530G) or Suspend on low (630G) alarm and take measures to prevent or treat hypoglycemia themselves. The information provided by CGM systems is intended to supplement, not replace, blood glucose information obtained using a blood glucose meter. A confirmatory fingerstick via a CONTOUR®NEXT LINK portfolio meter*, is required prior to making adjustments to diabetes therapy. Always check the pump display when using a CONTOUR®NEXT LINK portfolio meter*, to ensure the glucose result shown agrees with the glucose results shown on the meter. Additional, warnings, precautions and contraindications apply. See   and   for details.    MiniMed® 670G System  -The Medtronic MiniMed 670G system requires a prescription and is intended for continuous delivery of basal insulin (at user selectable rates) and administration of insulin boluses (in user selectable amounts) for the management of Type 1 diabetes mellitus in persons, fourteen years of age and older, requiring insulin as well as for the continuous monitoring and trending of glucose levels in the fluid under the skin. The MiniMed 670G System includes SmartGuard technology, which can be programmed to automatically adjust delivery of basal insulin based on Continuous Glucose Monitor sensor glucose values, and can suspend delivery of insulin when the sensor glucose value falls below or is predicted to fall below predefined threshold values.    The Guardian Sensor (3) is not intended to be used directly for making therapy adjustments, but rather to provide an indication of when a finger stick may be required. All therapy adjustments should be based on measurements obtained using a home glucose monitor and not on values provided by the Guardian Sensor (3).    WARNING: Medtronic performed an evaluation of the MiniMed 670G system and determined that it may not be safe for use in children under the age of 7 because of the way that the system is designed and the daily insulin requirements. Therefore this device should not be used in anyone under the age of 7 years old. This device should also not be used in patients who require less than a total daily insulin dose of 8 units per day because the device requires a minimum of 8 units per day to operate safely.    Pump therapy is not recommended for people whose vision or hearing does not allow recognition of pump signals and alarms. Do not use the serter on products other than the Enlite sensor or Guardian Sensor (3). Medtronic cannot guarantee the safety or efficacy of this product if used with other products. The reservoir is contraindicated for the infusion of blood or blood products. Infusion sets are indicated for subcutaneous use only and not for intravenous (IV) infusion or the infusion of blood or blood products. Insulin pump therapy is not recommended for those who are unwilling to perform at least four blood glucose tests per day. As insulin pumps use rapid acting insulin only, BG testing is required to help identify rapid glycemic deterioration due to insulin infusion occlusion, infusion site problems, insulin stability issues, user error, or a combination of these. Pump therapy is not recommended for people who are unwilling or unable to maintain contact with their healthcare professional.    The safety of the 670G system has not been studied in people with impaired kidney function. Please let your healthcare professional know if you have kidney disease so you and your healthcare professional can determine if the potential benefits of using the system outweigh the risks. The safety of the 670G system has not been studied in pregnant women, people with type 2 diabetes, or in people using other anti-hyperglycemic therapies apart from insulin.     Please let your healthcare professional know if any of these conditions apply to you so you and your healthcare professional can determine if the potential benefits of using the system outweigh the risks.    Medtronic Diabetes Insulin Infusion Pumps  - Insulin pump therapy is not recommended for individuals who are unable or unwilling to perform a minimum of four blood glucose tests per day.   - Insulin pumps use rapid-acting insulin. If your insulin delivery is interrupted for any reason, you must be prepared to replace the missed insulin immediately.     Medtronic Diabetes Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) Systems  - The information provided by CGM systems is intended to supplement, not replace, blood glucose information obtained using a home glucose meter. A confirmatory fingerstick is required prior to treatment.   - Insertion of a glucose sensor may cause bleeding or irritation at the insertion site.

Follow Robert on Twitter @theRealKiyosaki and Instagram @TheRealKiyosaki. Male Best known as the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad —the #1 personal finance book of all time—Robert Kiyosaki has challenged and changed the way tens of millions of p New to Rich Dad?    I had two dads - a rich one and a poor one. eople around the world think about money. He is an entrepreneur, educator, and investor who believes that each of us has the power to makes changes in our lives, take control of our financial future, and live the rich life we deserve.    With perspectives on money and investing that often contradict conventional wisdom, Robert has earned an international reputation for straight talk, irreverence, and courage and has become a passionate and outspoken advocate for financial education.    Robert’s newest book—FAKE: Fake Money, Fake Teachers, Fake Assets—will release in April of 2019. Two other recent books—Why the Rich Are Getting Richer and More Important Than Money—were published in the spring of 2017 to mark the 20th Anniversary of the 1997 release of Rich Dad Poor Dad. That book and its messages, viewed around the world as a classic in the personal finance arena, have stood the test of time and continues to resonate with audiences of all ages around the world.    Robert has also co-authored two books with Donald Trump, prior to his successful bid for the White House and election as President of the United States.    To learn more visit     One dad was highly educated and intelligent; he had a Ph.D. and had completed four years of undergraduate work in less than two years. He then went to Stanford University, the University of Chicago, and Northwestern University to do his advanced studies, all on full, financial scholarships.    My other dad never finished the eighth grade. Both men were successful in their careers, worked hard all their lives, and both earned substantial incomes.    Yet one dad struggled financially all his life and the other dad would become one of the richest men in Hawaii. One died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family, charities, and his church. The other left a legacy of unpaid bills. Both men were strong, charismatic, and influential. Both men offered me advice, but they did not advise the same things.    Rich Dad Poor Dad - Contrasting Points of View    Having two dads as advisors offered me the perspective of contrasting points of view: one of a rich man and one of a poor man. The problem was that my rich dad was not yet rich, and my poor dad not yet poor. Both were just starting out in their careers; both were struggling with money and families.    But, regardless of those commonalities, both had very different points of view on the subject of money.    One dad would say, ""The love of money is the root of all evil."" The other, ""The lack of money is the root of all evil."" Having two dads - and loving them both - forced me to think about, and ultimately choose, a way of thinking for myself.    I had to think about each dad's advice and, in doing so, gained valuable insights into the power and effect of one's thoughts on one's life. For example: My poor dad had a habit of saying, ""I can't afford it."" My rich dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted that I say, ""How can I afford it?"" One is a statement, the other a question. One lets you off the hook; the other forces you to think. My rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words ""I can't afford it"" your brain stops working. By asking the question ""How can I afford it?"" your brain is put to work.    Exercise your mind    My rich dad did not mean 'buy everything you wanted.' He was, though, fanatical about exercising your mind – the most powerful computer in the world. My rich dad said: ""My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make."" He believed that automatically saying ""I can't afford it"" was a sign of mental laziness.    Although both dads worked hard, I noticed that my poor dad had a habit of putting his brain to sleep when it came to money matters. My rich dad, on the other hand, made a habit of exercising his brain. The long-term result was that one dad grew stronger financially and the other grew weaker.    Our Thoughts Shape Our Lives    Being a product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of observing the effects that different thoughts have on one's life. I noticed that people really do shape their lives through their thoughts.    The power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated, but it became obvious to me as a young boy that there was value and power in being aware of my thoughts and how I expressed myself. I noticed that my poor dad was poor not because of the amount of money he earned – which was significant – but because of his thoughts and actions. As a young boy, having two fathers, I became acutely aware of being careful in deciding which thoughts I chose to adopt as my own and to whom should I listen to – my rich dad or my poor dad?    At the age of nine, I decided to listen to and learn from my rich dad about money. In doing so, I chose to not listen to my poor dad – my real dad – even though he was the one with all the college degrees.    Dad Differences    One of my dads was a multimillionaire. The other was a poor man. Why? Very simply, it comes down to their respective attitudes toward money and life. Take a look at the differences and think about where you fit...                      Poor Dad vs. Rich Dad  				  My Poor Dad said:  ""My house is an asset.""  	    My Rich Dad said: ""My house is a liability."" 	    	  		  	   Rich dad says, ""If you stop working today, an asset puts money in your pocket and a liability takes money from your pocket. Too often people call liabilities assets. It's important to know the difference between the two."" 	    	  		  	   Poor Dad: ""I can't afford it."" 	  	    Rich Dad: ""How can I afford it?"" 	    	  		  	   The statement ""I can't afford it"" shuts down your thinking. By asking the right question, your mind opens up and looks for answers. 	    	  		  	   ""It's not how much money you make that's important – it's how much money you keep and how long you keep it."" 	    Understanding the difference in attitudes between Rich Dad and Poor Dad is essential to taking the first steps to financial freedom.    For a comprehensive look at how to battle the Poor Dad mentality and adopt the Rich Dad state of mind, learn more about the tools we offer to help you on your journey to financial freedom.  				  - Robert"

George Wingate to “promote and encourage rifle shooting on a scientific basis.”  In the following decades, the NRA provided world-class firearms instruction to thousands of gun owners across the country.     When anti-gun lobbyists and politicians began their war on the Second Amendment four decades ago, the NRA fought back.  And over the years, we’ve defeated hundreds of attempts on the national, state and local levels to infringe on your Right to Keep and Bear Arms.     Today, NRA stands as America’s oldest civil rights organization.  Every time there’s a threat to your gun rights, the National Rifle Association is there to defend your freedom.  NRA also provides firearms training and gun safety programs to gun owners from all walks of life."

Wir alle brauchen irgendwann im Leben passives Einkommen – spätestens dann, wenn wir nicht mehr arbeiten können oder wollen. immocation hilft dir dabei, eine kleine Wohnung zu kaufen und zu vermieten. So, dass sie als optimale Geldanlage funktioniert.     immocation richtet sich an Einsteiger, setzt wenig Eigenkapital und kein Vorwissen voraus.     Wir, Marco und Stefan, haben durch den Kauf 6 kleiner Eigentumswohnungen innerhalb von 2 Jahren unsere eigene Rente erschaffen. Unsere erste Wohnung hat 58.000€ gekostet, wir haben 7.000€ Eigenkapital eingesetzt und alle Wohnungen bezahlen sich von selbst ab:   Die Mieteinnahmen reichen aus, um die Bankrate zu bezahlen, laufende Kosten zu decken und Rücklagen zu bilden. Später können wir von den Mieteinnahmen leben.     immocation basiert außerdem auf den Erfahrungen aus der Zusammenarbeit mit über 10.000 Kunden.     Mit unserem startup unterstützen wir Menschen beim Kauf einer Wohnung als Geldanlage – mit dem notwendigen Wissen und den passenden Werkzeugen.    Für wen ist immocation gedacht?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Vielleicht möchtest du nicht mehr nur jeden Monat Miete bezahlen, sondern auch Miete erhalten und Vermögen aufbauen. Vielleicht geht es dir wie uns und du steckst viel Zeit und Energie in deinen Job – wenn du genau hinschaust, kommen deine privaten Finanzen zu kurz.     Vielleicht denkst du schon länger darüber nach, eine Immobilie zu kaufen – aber du bist unsicher, wie daraus eine funktionierende Geldanlage wird.     Vielleicht suchst du eine transparente Geldanlage, die du selbst umsetzen und verstehen kannst – weil du weißt, dass es sonst niemand für dich tut.     Stell dir vor, du wüsstest schon jetzt, dass du im Alter ein gesichertes Einkommen hast. Könntest du dein Leben nicht schon heute ganz anders gestalten?     Was auch immer dich antreibt: Eine Wohnung zu kaufen, die als optimale Geldanlage funktioniert, war die beste finanzielle Entscheidung, die wir je getroffen haben.    Was dich bei immocation erwartet  --------------------------------------------------------------------------  Im Kern ist immocation ein Konzept, das wir in unserem Buch (""Die Do-it-yourself-Rente"") beschreiben:       immocation ist aber noch viel mehr:    In unserer Facebook Gruppe helfen wir dir persönlich bei der Umsetzung:     Unsere Werkzeuge begleiten dich beim Wohnungskauf (Kalkulation, Bewertung, Besichtigung, Bank, Notar):     Unsere App hilft dir dabei in wenigen Sekunden zu verstehen ob eine angebotene Wohnung ein gute Geldanlage ist oder nicht:     Zahlreiche Erklärvideos vermitteln dir das notwendige Wissen - von den Basic bis hin zur detaillierten Kalkulation.

Welcome To The Vault available now:  Steve Miller Band 'Ultimate Hits' Out Now. Get/Stream here:  Livin' In The USA Steve Miller was a mainstay of the San Francisco music scene that upended American culture in the late '60s. With albums like Children of the Future, Sailor and  Brave New World, Miller perfected a psychedelic blues sound that drew on the deepest sources of American roots music and simultaneously articulated a compelling vision of what music - and, indeed, society - could be in the years to come. Then, in the '70s, Miller crafted a brand of pure pop that was polished, exciting and irresistible - and that dominated radio in a way that few artists have ever managed. Hit followed hit in what seemed like an endless flow: ""Take The Money and Run,"" ""Rock'n Me,"" ""Fly Like an Eagle,"" ""Jet Airliner"" and ""Jungle Love,"" among them. To this day, those songs are instantly recognizable when they come on the radio - and impossible not to sing along with. Their hooks are the very definition of indelible. Running through Miller's distinctive catalog is a combination of virtuosity and song craft. His parents were jazz aficionados - not to mention close friends of Les Paul and Mary Ford - so, as a budding guitarist, Miller absorbed valuable lessons from that musical tradition. When the family moved to Texas, Miller deepened his education in the blues, eventually moving to Chicago, where he played with Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Buddy Guy and Paul Butterfield. In recent years, Miller has immersed himself in the blues once again. And, as always, whether he was riding the top of the charts or exploring the blue highways of American music, he is playing and singing with conviction and precision, passion and eloquence, and making records that are at once immediately accessible and more than able to stand the test of time.   -Anthony DeCurtis-"

This include Hello! My name is Emil and I live outside the city of Gothenburg in southern Sweden.  After I graduated from my five-year university education to become an engin s growing as a person, constantly learning new things and skills to share with others. It also includes opening up the mind to the fantastic opportunities the new digital economy is offering. With possibilities of working from anywhere in the world with freedom of time and finances hard for many people to imagine. eer I started working as an engineering consultant focusing on software verification. I really enjoyed this work at the start and I felt like I developed both on a professional and a personal level. After working with this for around two years though, there was a growing discomfort in my mind that I couldn't put my finger on. This discomfort grew stronger and stronger and I started to realize that this 9 to 5 setup with boring meetings and stressed people everywhere around wasn't at all what I wanted the rest of my life to look like.     I've always been very interested in personal development and eager to learn new skills and interested in health and exercising. I had however never enough time to do these things or spend enough time with the people closest to me. The things I actually loved most and valued highest in my life had to be sacrificed in order to earn money to pay my bills. I realized that this would probably always be the case as long as I had to trade my precious time for money, thus I started to look for alternatives.     After a while I encountered SFM (The Six Figure Mentors), which really was an eye-opener for me into a world I actually didn't knew existed before. Working in the digital world is so different from working in traditional jobs, the amount of freedom you can get is so huge in comparison. Joining SFM was one of the absolutely best decisions of my life and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants more freedom in their lives, both in terms of finances and time!"

They knew they could develop a safer way to clean.    No one thought it could be done, but after three years of development, they perfected a non-toxic, non-flammable, and non-abrasive formula. Independent testing proved both the efficacy and safety of their new product.    After its initial success, Bruce began selling Simple Green to automotive and industrial customers for use as a cleaner on equipment and floors. he personally delivered 55-gallon drums of the product in his own van.

In 1989, Bruce FaBrizio and Simple Green founded the EGBAR® Foundation. EGBAR is an acronym for Everything's Gonna Be All Right.

After its initial success, Bruce began selling Simple Green to automotive and industrial customers in 55-gallon drums; which he delivered in his van, for use as a cleaner on equipment and floors.    In 1979, just as initial retail marketing efforts were beginning to pay off, Bruce's father died. Bruce managed to keep the business alive and in 1981 gave his company the name it continues to carry — Sunshine Makers, Inc. Simple Green was then introduced nationally into several new markets including Hardware/Do It Yourself, consumer grocery & drug, GSA (government) and Club-Store classes of trade. In the early 1990s, Bruce created the Environmental Technology Division within his company in order to define the cutting edge of today's cleaning solutions and solidify his company's high standards for environmental responsibility. The safety and efficacy claims made by Simple Green have been proven repeatedly by independent laboratories and third party testing facilities.    The company remains committed to the development of products that provide safer alternatives to traditional harsh chemicals. Sunshine Makers, Inc. is still owned and operated by Bruce P. FaBrizio. Bruce lives in Corona Del Mar, California with his wife Viviana and their happy family of five pampered pooches.

Peach Tree Rascals started self-releasing music in 2018 and have accumulated over 20 million streams to date. Comprised of producer/mixer Dom, rapper/singers Issac, Tarrek & Joseph, and creative director Jorge, the five-piece collective first met in high school in the Bay Area. Issac, having had an early start in recording and releasing music, moved to San Jose where he befriended and eventually began collaborating with Tarrek, Dom and Joseph. Jorge rounds out the group, taking the lead on photos, merch, and music videos. Many of the Rascals are first generation Americans with parents who immigrated from Mexico, Philippines, and Palestine. That immigrant mentality comes through in the way they approach the project and their work ethic. For the guys, Peach Tree Rascals is their extended family, and they've self-funded the project through various jobs including working at Red Lobster and their local print shop. As the group often says, “We're the Rascals and we do the best with what we’ve got, even if it’s not much.”     All songs and visuals done in house. 100% PTR made."
